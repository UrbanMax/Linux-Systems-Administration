Step 1: Ensure/Double Check Permissions on Sensitive Files

Permissions on /etc/shadow:
ls -l /etc/shadow

Command to set permissions (if needed):
sudo chmod go-rwx /etc/shadow

Permissions on /etc/gshadow:
ls -l /etc/gshadow

Command to set permissions (if needed):
sudo chmod go-rwx /etc/gshadow

Permissions on /etc/group:
ls -l /etc/group

Command to set permissions (if needed):
sudo chmod 644 /etc/group

Permissions on /etc/passwd:
ls -l /etc/passwd

Command to set permissions (if needed):
sudo chmod 644 /etc/passwd

Step 2: Create User Accounts
Add user accounts for sam, joe, amy, sara, and admin1:

sudo useradd sam
sudo useradd joe
sudo useradd amy
sudo useradd sara
sudo useradd admin1

Ensure only admin1 has general sudo access:
sudo usermod -aG sudo admin1

Step 3: Create User Group and Collaborative Folder

Add an engineers group to the system:
sudo addgroup engineers

Add users sam, joe, amy, and sara to the engineers group:

sudo usermod -aG engineers sam
sudo usermod -aG engineers joe
sudo usermod -aG engineers amy
sudo usermod -aG engineers sara

Create a shared folder for engineers at /home/engineers:
sudo mkdir /home/engineers

Change ownership of the engineers' shared folder to the engineers group:
sudo chown :engineers /home/engineers

Step 4: Lynis Auditing
Install Lynis:
sudo apt install lynis

Run an audit with Lynis:
sudo lynis audit system

Note: Follow the prompts and recommendations from Lynis audit output to address system hardening.
Optional Additional Challenge

Install chkrootkit:
sudo apt install chkrootkit

Run chkrootkit in expert mode for detailed output:
sudo chkrootkit -x

Note: Review the chkrootkit output for any suspicious findings and follow any recommendations for system hardening.
